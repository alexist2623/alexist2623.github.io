                            Typical AWG device lacks capability to generate arbitrary waveform for TIQC, since these
                            utilizes only BRAM. To overcome this limitation, AWG utilizing DRAM is implemented. 
                            To prevent unpredictable latency due to DRAM refresh, waveform data is aligned to memory
                            row size, and data transaction is scheduled equally.
