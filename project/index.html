                        User can select RF source: DDS or AWG.
                        DDS generates sin wave with given frequency, amplitude, and phase parameters.
                        Changing frequency does change only accumulating phase value, which changes phase continuously.
                        However, some experiments require phase change in stepwise, and to meet timing constraints, 
                        2 pipelined MAC which utilizes Vedic algorithm is used.

                        Due to the limitations of FPGA resources, synthesizing multiple DDS modules to create multi-tone signals 
                        is constrained. To overcome this, we implemented AWG functionality. Unlike superconducting qubits, 
                        ion trap-based quantum computers require longer pulse durations. To address this, we developed a 
                        module that controls data transactions between DRAM and DAC.

                        However, quantum computer controllers may not do so in order to prevent overflow of the module's FIFO. 
                        We have developed a method to prevent this by combining module and firmware solutions
