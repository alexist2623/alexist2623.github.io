                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <img width="600" alt="image" src="./CircuitDiagram.png">
                        <p class="bullet">
                            Daughter board which transmit RF signal to optical modulator which drive quantum gate 
                            for trapped ion. Typical frequency region is 200MHz, and to transform from differential RF
                            signals to single ended, balun is placed.
                        </p>

                    <h2> Design Consideration </h2>
                        <h3>PI pad</h3>
                            <p class="bullet">
                                PI pad is placed in front of balun to suppress reflection.
                                It does not affect impedance of circuit, but only attenuate RF signal.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Balun</h3>
                            <p class="bullet">
                                The balun converts the differential RF signal to a single-ended signal.
                                Because its passband starts above DC, only the AC component is transmitted through the balun.
                            </p>
                        
                        <h3>Stitching via/trace shielding</h3>
                            <img width="500" alt="image" src="./stitch_via.png">
                            <p class="bullet">
                                Stitching vias help shield the signal trace from external noise.
                                A common guideline is to space stitching vias no more than one-tenth of the wavelength 
                                at the highest target frequency; placing them even closer poses no problem and can further 
                                enhance shielding.
                            </p>
                        
                            <img width="500" alt="image" src="./trace.png">
                            <p class="bullet">
                                The RF trace is normally routed as a strip-line between two ground planes for noise immunity.
                                Where the trace must surface to the top or bottom layer—to reach a component such as a balun 
                                or filter—it is enclosed under an EMC shield which is mounted on the top layer, maintaining 
                                isolation at that transition.
                            </p>
                        
                        <h3>Phase match</h3>
                            <img width="500" alt="image" src="./phase_match.png">
                            <p class="bullet">
                                When a differential pair turns a corner, the outer trace travels a slightly longer path than 
                                the inner trace. 
                                This skew introduces phase mismatch, converting some of the differential 
                                signal to common-mode noise. 
                                The imbalance can be mitigated by enforcing phase (length) matching at every bend—typically 
                                by inserting small rounded “bulges,” i.e., length-compensation 
                                bumps, in the shorter inner trace—so that both conductors remain electrically equal in length.
                            </p>
                            
                        <h3>Length match</h3>
                            <p class="bullet">
                                Signal length should be matched to guarantee the same signal latency.
                            </p>
                        
                        <h3>Component hole</h3>
                            <img width="500" alt="image" src="./hole_match.png">
                            <p class="bullet">
                                A typical SMT component pad presents a large copper area, which significantly increases parasitic 
                                inductance. 
                                This unwanted inductance can be mitigated by back-drilling a hole beneath the top or 
                                bottom plane where component is soldered.
                            </p>
                        
                        <h3>Impedance at connector</h3>
                            <img width="500" alt="image" src="./impedance_at_hole.png">
                            <p class="bullet">
                                A solder-less SMA connector offers the best impedance continuity because the signal path avoids 
                                any solder-induced discontinuity. 
                                However, it is expensive and its advantage is negligible outside the millimetre-wave band, so 
                                a plated through-hole (PTH) SMA is employed instead. 
                                As the signal transitions from the PCB trace to the PTH connector, it encounters an impedance mismatch. 
                                This mismatch is mitigated by drilling an oversized anti-pad (a “coax-sized” clearance) around 
                                the centre pin, ensuring that the transition maintains the target impedance and thereby minimises 
                                return loss (S11).
                            </p>
                        
                        <h3>Analog/digital ground isolation</h3>

                            <p class="bullet">
                                Routing digital and analog traces in separate PCB regions usually provides adequate ground isolation. 
                                To further reduce coupling, the ground planes are physically split, and the switching regulator is 
                                placed on an isolated “island” so that its switching noise remains confined.
                            </p>

                                suppression, to suppress unwanted EMI to RF signal, RF signals are shielded with ground plane. When the RF signals
